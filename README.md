## Jarvis-
## An A.I project which can perform multiple tasks using voice recognition and speak like human.

This AI assistant can help anyone who’s lazy considering the fact that it can search Wikipedia, open camera, take screenshot, can tell our location, open an application of our will, play songs, pause songs, shut down, restart the system, tell the battery percentage, tell jokes, search on YouTube etc. through some simple voice command.

 In today’s world where time is everything, we have created an AI assistant which will save a lot of our time through features like searching a YouTube video, opening any application etc. without wasting much time.

## Key Features/Benefits:

●       As we already know, the harmful rays (which comes out of laptops and mobile phones) can be very harmful to us no matter even if we are reading a news article or an e-book etc. To avoid such a thing Our AI assistant will make a file of the mp3 format of the text provided and read it out loud automatically. So, reading an e-book without the fear of exposure to blue light in today’s world where most of our time is on the computer screen can very helpful to a lot of people.
